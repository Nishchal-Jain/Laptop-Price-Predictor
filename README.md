# Laptop-Price-Predictor
A supervised machine learning project that predicts laptop prices based on their specifications such as processor type, RAM, storage, GPU, and brand.
The model was trained using a dataset of 1300+ real-world laptop entries from Kaggle.
Key Features:
Implemented data preprocessing using NumPy and Pandas to handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numerical features.
Trained multiple regression models and finalized the Random Forest Regressor for its superior performance and accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Deployed the trained model using Streamlit, creating an interactive web interface for users to input laptop specs and get an instant price prediction.
Tech Stack:
Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub
Outcome:
The project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation to web deployment
